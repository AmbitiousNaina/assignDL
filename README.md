In this notebook, we will classify small images using CIFAR-10 dataset from tensorflow keras datasets. There are total 10 classes as shown below. We will use CNN for classification with Flask API.
The CIFAR-10 dataset consists of 60000 32x32 colour images in 10 classes, with 6000 images per class. There are 50000 training images and 10000 test images
